## Part 1: HTML
You will now create a project page for your team in HTML.

Create an HTML page named index.html

Your HTML index page must contain the following elements:

1. A basic, correct HTML page structure, including your document type declaration, head, title, and body sections.
2. A header div, containing an H1 header tag
    - This element should have a class selector on it.
    - The content should be the subject of your page.
3. Add an image of either a University of Maryland logo or of the Testudo sculpture to your header div.
4. A container div that can hold all of your content, with a class name of wrapper.
5. A div element for your content body.
    - This element must also have a class selector on it.
6. Two generic block-level elements (div) nested within your content div, both with class selectors.
7. One of those div elements should contain an image (it doesn't have to be of you, but it should be, ahem, family-friendly), followed by a short "caption" description of the image contained in p tag.
8. The other block-level element should contain a second-level header, a single descriptive paragraph explaining a bit about your page, and at least 3 text items, such as work history elements or fan stats (real or imagined) in an ordered list. Create these in such a way that you can style each of the 3 entries at the same time.  Include:
    - A header of the appropriate level.
    - A description of the stat or job in question.
    - And an unordered list of three text points related to the header.

## Part 2: CSS
1. Create an external CSS page named "styles.css".
2. Attach this CSS file to your HTML index page using a link in the head element.
3. Complete the following styling using only class name selectors from your HTML. Do not use ID or element tags.
4. Use flexbox, padding, and margins for your layouts. Do not use clears and floats.

Using your CSS stylesheet (inline edits will not be scored):

1. Set the background color of your header div in HTML-1 to a dark color and change the text color to a light color.
2. Set your header div to take up the entire width of a page, with no edge spacing.
    - Ensure all elements are vertically centered within the header block.
    - Your name should be to the left, and your image to the right.
    - Your elements should wrap when your page size changes.
    - Your header should have fifteen pixels of space between it and your content div.
    - When your page is compressed, your elements should center themselves horizontally.
3. Set your content div to take up no more than 960px of page width.
4. Using your wrapper div, set your content div to always be horizontally centered in the page.
5. Using flexbox, display your main content divs next to one another.
6. Ensure your image is on top of your caption text, to the left of your roles and responsibilities.
7. Make sure that as your page changes size, your elements wrap below one another properly.
8. Set your image and caption to take up no more than 1/3 of the flex space, and your descriptive div to take no less than 2/3 of the space.
9. Allow your image to take up no more space than the maximum width of your left column.
    - Do not change the size of your UMD logo/Testudo picture while doing this.
10. Using shorthand, add a solid, one-pixel border to your image.
11. Set your image to have rounded corners of 4px.
12. Ensure your list element headers and page header have a different font than your body fonts.
    - Import no more than three weights of a display font from Google Fonts for this.
13. Style your work history entries so that they all end up consistent in their appearance.
    - Change your role title so it stands out by adjusting no more than two rules.
14. Set your body background to a pale color and highlight the background of your text and image.
15. Add a maximum screen size break at 1000 pixels.
16. If your display size is less than 1000 pixels...
    - Set your container to center content in the page
    - Set your image-and-caption box to form a row
    - Evenly space your image and caption within that row
    - Set a bottom margin on your image and caption to ensure good spacing.

## Submission
<ul>
  <li>Your final submission will be an update to a repository that is legible on Heroku.</li>
  <li>You will need to create a new repository, separate from your course repo, for this project.</li>
  <li>Your final link will look something like https://your-project-name.herokuapp.com</li>
  <li>Late assignments can achieve a grade no higher than 80%, or B-</li>
  <li>Assignments will not be accepted after the assignment closes</li>
  <li>Your assignment link must work properly, or your assignment will not be accepted.</li>
</ul>

## Grading
<p>While you will ideally achieve one point per item in the below list, a number of the assignment provisions are interdependent, and cannot be achieved without correctly achieving other steps.</p>

<p>This assignment is also graded such that a minimum achievement will be rewarded to a minimum level: each element can be achieved to requirements, and can also earn grades above the base level.</p>
